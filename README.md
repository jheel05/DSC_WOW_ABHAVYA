'Abhavya' is a website that is developed with an intention of keeping women in society safe and secure.
As the name suggests, every woman is incredible, and to make her feel protected and safe we started this initiative. We focus on bringing justice to all the victims out there and making them self confident by providing different self-defense and educational courses. We make them feel special by organizing various events. We motivate women by sharing different real-life inspiring stories shared by women via blogs. 

##### Women: A Century of Change.

Women are the future fundamental of every country.
We focus on strengthening the measures for the safety of women in the country and instill a greater sense of security in them through speedy and effective administration of justice in a holistic manner and by providing a safer environment for women.
We provide a platform for women to report crimes against them and to seek mental and physical help. We promise every woman to make them feel safer and protected.

## SERVICES 
- Register a rape case.
- Register case against stalking.
- Online harassment case.
- Report acid attack.
- Learn Self-Defence.
- Organize an event or seek education. 
 
 Many women are unaware of their fundamental rights, so to let them know about their basic rights we have a "Rights" column. Where they can have enough knowledge about it.
 If a woman feels unsafe or wants to share something, she can have a one-to-one conversation with the coordinator of the site using our chat box function.
 We don't reveal victim's identity in public.
